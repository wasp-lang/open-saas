description: Describes where the ui components built on top with Shadcn UI exist, how they are customized, and Wasp specific rules concerning how new ShadCN UI components should be installed

Due to dependency conflicts Wasp cannot be used with Tailwindcss v4.

ShadCN has already been setup with this project template, so there is no need to install it. All the ShadCN specific components exist in [src/client/components/ui](../../src/client/components/ui/)

## Adding a new ShadCN component

We will use button as an example.
Same rules apply to any ShadCN component.

### 1. Add a new component 

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

This will generate a button component in `src/client/components/ui/button.tsx`.

### 2. Adjust the `utils` import in `button.tsx` 

```diff
import * as React from "react"
import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot"
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"

-import { cn } from "src/lib/utils"
+import { cn } from "../../utils"
```

### 3. Use the `Button` React component

Now you are ready to use the `Button` component. That's it!
```tsx
import { Button } from './components/ui/button'

function SomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>This works</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
