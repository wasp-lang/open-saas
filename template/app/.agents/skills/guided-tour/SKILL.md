# Guided Tour of Open SaaS

Follow these steps in order:

## Step 1: Fetch the Documentation Map

Fetch the Open SaaS documentation map from the [LLMs.txt index](https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms.txt). This contains raw markdown file GitHub URLs of all documentation sections.

## Step 2: Fetch the Guided Tour Guide

From the documentation map, find the "Guided Tour" guide URL (a raw.githubusercontent.com URL) and fetch its full contents. This is your source of truth for the entire tour.

## Step 3: Walk Through the Tour Step-by-Step

Guide the user through the Guided Tour document section by section:

1. Present each section's content clearly and concisely.
2. Point out relevant files and code in the project as they relate to each section.
3. After each major section, pause and ask the user if they have any questions before moving on.
4. If the user asks a question, answer it using the guide content, the project's code, or by fetching additional documentation from the docs map if needed.

Keep the pace comfortable — don't rush through sections. The goal is for the user to understand their project, not just read documentation.
