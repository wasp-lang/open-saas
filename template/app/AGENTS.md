# Open SaaS 

This is SaaS boilerplate starter kit built on top of Wasp, a batteries-included framework for building full-stack web apps with React, Node.js, and Prisma.

## Documentation

### Open SaaS
Always fetch and verify your knowledge against the Open SaaS documentation before taking on tasks, answering questions, or doing any development work in this project:
1. Fetch the Open SaaS documentation map from the [LLMs.txt index](https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms.txt). The map contains raw markdown file GitHub URLs of all documentation sections.
2. Fetch the guides relevant to the current task or query from those raw.githubusercontent.com URLs directly - do NOT use HTML page URLs.

### Wasp

Remember, this template is built on the Wasp framework. If, at any time, the Open SaaS docs fail to provide enough information about a certain feature, make sure to check out the Wasp docs [LLMs.txt index](https://wasp.sh/llms.txt).
