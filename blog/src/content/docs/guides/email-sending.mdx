This guide explains how to use the integrated email sender and how you can integrate your own account in this template.

## Sending Emails

In the `main.wasp` config file, you'll see we've got the email sender set up for you:

```tsx title="main.wasp"
app SaaSTemplate {
  // ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: SendGrid,
    defaultFrom: {
      name: "Open SaaS App",
      // make sure this address is the same you registered your SendGrid or MailGun account with!
      email: "my@email.com" 
    },
  },
```

This means that you can send emails from your app using the `send` function from the `email` module:

```tsx title="src/server/webhooks.ts"
import { emailSender } from "wasp/server/email";

//...

  if (subscription.cancel_at_period_end) {
    await emailSender.send({
      to: customer.email,
      subject: 'We hate to see you go :(',
      text: 'We hate to see you go. Here is a sweet offer...',
      html: 'We hate to see you go. Here is a sweet offer...',
    });
  }
```

In the example above, you can see that we're sending an email to the customer when we receive a cancel subscription event within the Stripe webhook. 

This is a powerful feature and super simple to use.

:::tip[Sending Emails in Development]
In the `.env.server` file, we've set the `SEND_EMAILS_IN_DEVELOPMENT` env variable to false. This means that emails won't actually be sent in development, rather only logged to the console. 

If you'd like to actually send emails in development, you can turn it on by setting it to true.

## Integrate your email sender

To set up your email sender, you first need an account with one of the supported email providers.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="SendGrid">
    - Register at SendGrid.com and then get your [API KEYS](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).
    - Copy yours to the `.env.server` file under the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` variable.  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="MailGun">
    - Go to [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) and create an account.
    - Go to [API Keys](https://app.mailgun.com/app/account/security/api_keys) and create a new API key.
    - Copy the API key and add it to your .env.server file under the `MAILGUN_API_KEY=` variable.
    - Go to [Domains](https://app.mailgun.com/app/domains) and create a new domain.
    - Copy the domain and add it to your .env.server file as `MAILGUN_DOMAIN=`.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Make sure to change the `defaultFrom` email address in the `main.wasp` file to the same email address you used to register your account with.

```tsx title="main.wasp" {5}
emailSender: {
  provider: SendGrid,
  defaultFrom: {
    name: "Open SaaS App",
    email: "my@email.com" 
  },
```
