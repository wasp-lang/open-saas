# Template Testing

Tests the production version of the Open SaaS template that users get from `wasp new app -t saas`.

**Why this exists:** As a part of our release checklist, we want to test that the production version of the Open SaaS template works.

**How it works:** We create a new Wasp app from the production Open SaaS template, and then modify the app to be production-ready (e.g. replace `Dummy` email service with `SMTP`, add Dotenv Vault with real credentials, etc.). 

## Testing a new Wasp release

When testing a new Wasp release:

```bash
cd template-test
# Create a new Wasp app and apply our patches to it.
./tools/patch.sh

cd app

# Get the environment variables from Dotenv Vault.
npm run env:pull

# Run the dev database and create migrations.
wasp db start
wasp db migrate-dev --name "init"

# You can stop the dev database after you created the migration.

# Test that the app works in dev and prod modes.
# Make sure the `@wasp.sh/wasp-app-runner` is updated to the latest version.
npx @wasp.sh/wasp-app-runner dev
npx @wasp.sh/wasp-app-runner build
```

### If you want to update the template test app

- Generate `app/` from template and diffs: `./tools/patch.sh`
- Modify the app in `app/` as needed and then update diffs: `./tools/diff.sh`

For detailed information about the diff/patch workflow and MacOS setup requirements, see [../tools/README.md](../tools/README.md).
