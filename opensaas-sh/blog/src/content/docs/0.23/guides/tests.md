This guide will show you how to use the included end-to-end (e2e) tests for your Open SaaS application.

## The Tests Directory

In the root of your project, you'll find an `e2e-tests` directory which contains the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) tests for your Open SaaS application:

```
.
├── e2e-tests/
│   ├── tests/                  # Directory containing the test files
│   ├── README.md               # Instructions on how to run the tests
│   ├── playwright.config.ts    # Playwright configuration
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── ...
```

To run the tests locally, or in a CI pipeline, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file in the `e2e-tests` directory.

## Using Tests in CI with GitHub Actions

Although the Open SaaS template does not come with an example GitHub workflow, you can find out how Open SaaS itself set it up in `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` at [Open SaaS repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas).

You can copy and paste the `.github/` directory containing the `e2e-tests.yml` workflow into the root of your own repository to run the tests as part of your CI pipeline.

:::caution[WASP_VERSION]
Please make sure to update the `WASP_VERSION` environment variable in the `e2e-tests.yml` file to match the version of Wasp you are using in your project.
:::

In order for these tests to run correctly on GitHub, you need to provide the environment variables mentioned in the `e2e-tests.yml` file within your GitHub repository's "Actions" secrets so that they can be accessed by the tests.
