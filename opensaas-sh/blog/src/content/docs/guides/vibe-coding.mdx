If you're looking to use AI coding tools to help build your SaaS app, this guide is for you.

## Coding with AI, Open SaaS, & Wasp

Wasp is the perfect match for AI-assisted coding due to its central config file which gives LLMs immediate context about the entire full-stack app, as well as its ability to manage boilerplate code so AI doesn't have to. 

To make it even easier, here are some resources to help you use Wasp & Open SaaS with AI as effectively as possible.

## Agent Skills and Rules

We've put some agent skills and rules into the template to help you get started using Open SaaS with your favorite AI-assisted coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code/Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, etc.).

Skills are found in the `app/.agents` (and `app/.claude`) directory of the Open SaaS template, and follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard.
See your AI-assisted coding tool's documentation for more details on how to add Agent Skills if they don't load automatically.

Rules, found within the `AGENTS.md` (and `CLAUDE.md`), is another [open standard](https://agents.md/) used by many popular AI-assisted coding tools to give instructions to the agents when coding.

:::tip[These are just a starting point!]
Use these skills and rules to get your project up and running.

Run the `add-wasp-skills` skill to add [Wasp framework-specific skills](https://github.com/wasp-lang/claude-plugins/tree/main/plugins/wasp) to your project for even more power.
