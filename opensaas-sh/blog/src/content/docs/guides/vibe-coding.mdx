If you're looking to use AI to help build (or "vibe code") your SaaS app, this guide is for you.

## Coding with AI, Open SaaS, & Wasp

Wasp is the perfect match for vibe coding due to its central config file which gives LLMs immediate context about the entire full-stack app, as well as its ability to manage boilerplate code so AI doesn't have to. 

To make it even easier, here are some resources to help you use Wasp & Open SaaS with AI as effectively as possible.

## Agent Skills and Rules

We've packaged Wasp agent skills and rules into the template to be used by your favorite AI-assisted coding tools.

Skills are found in the `app/.claude` directory of the Open SaaS template, but because [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) are a standard, your AI-assisted coding tool will either load them automatically from the `.claude` directory, or you can add them to manually.
See your AI-assisted coding tool's documentation for more details on how to add Agent Skills.

Read more about the [AGENTS.md standard](https://agents.md/) to see if it's compatible with your AI-assisted coding tool of choice..

## LLM-Friendly Documentation

Note: the `AGENTS.md` has specific instructions on how to use the LLM-friendly documentation but you can also paste the following links in chat sessions if needed.

- [Open SaaS Docs - LLMs.txt](https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms.txt) - Links to the raw text docs.
- [Open SaaS Docs - LLMs-full.txt](https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms-full.txt) - Complete docs as one text file.
- [Wasp Docs - LLMs.txt](https://wasp.sh/llms.txt) - Links to the raw text docs by Wasp version.
- [Wasp Docs - LLMs-full.txt](https://wasp.sh/llms-full.txt) - Complete docs as one text file.

## MCP Server Installation

### Claude Code
For Claude Code users, the `app/.mcp.json` file is already located in the root of the project.

### Cursor / VS Code
Add the following to your `mcp.json` file:
```json
{
    // ... other MCP servers ...
    "Chrome DevTools": {
      "command": "npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest",
      "env": {},
      "args": []
    }
}
```
