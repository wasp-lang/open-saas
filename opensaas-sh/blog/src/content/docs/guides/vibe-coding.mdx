If you're looking to use AI to help build (or "vibe code") your SaaS app, this guide is for you.

## Coding with AI, Open SaaS, & Wasp

Wasp is the perfect match for vibe coding due to its central config file which gives LLMs immediate context about the entire full-stack app, as well as its ability to manage boilerplate code so AI doesn't have to. 

To make it even easier, here are some resources to help you use Wasp & Open SaaS with AI as effectively as possible.

## Wasp Plugin for Claude Code

If you're using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), you can install the official Wasp plugin to give it curated access to Wasp docs, workflows (such as guided deployments), and best practices.

Install the plugin by running the following commands in your terminal:

**1. Add the Wasp marketplace**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add wasp-lang/claude-plugins
```

**2. Install the Wasp plugin**
```bash
claude plugin install wasp@wasp-plugins --scope project
```

For more details on the plugin features and how to use it, see the:
- [Wasp Claude Code plugin repository](https://github.com/wasp-lang/claude-plugins/tree/main/plugins/wasp).


## LLM-Friendly Documentation

We've also created a bunch of LLM-friendly documentation:
- [Open SaaS Docs - LLMs.txt](https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms.txt) - Links to the raw text docs.
- [Open SaaS Docs - LLMs-full.txt](https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms-full.txt) - Complete docs as one text file.
- [Wasp Docs - LLMs.txt](https://wasp.sh/llms.txt) - Links to the raw text docs by Wasp version.
- [Wasp Docs - LLMs-full.txt](https://wasp.sh/llms-full.txt) - Complete docs as one text file.

If you're using an AI-assisted IDE like Cursor, you can add these to your settings so you can easily reference them in your chat sessions.
Or you can just pass the URLs directly into your chat sessions with your AI assistant.

:::note[Our Claude Code Plugin Does this Automatically!]
If you're using the [Wasp Claude Code plugin](#wasp-plugin-for-claude-code), it will automatically fetch the correct Wasp docs for the version of Wasp you're using to your chat sessions whenever you ask it about Wasp features or documentation.

## AI Rules & Example Prompts in the Template

The template also comes with:
- A full set of rules files, `app/.cursor/rules`, to be used with Cursor or adapted to your coding tool of choice (Windsurf, Claude Code, etc.).
- A set of example prompts, `app/.cursor/example-prompts.md`, to help you get started.
