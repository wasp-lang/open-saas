First, make sure you've defined your payment processor in `src/payment/paymentProcessor.ts`, as described in the [important first steps](#important-first-steps).

Next, you'll need to create a Lemon Squeezy account in test mode. You can do that [here](https://lemonsqueezy.com).

### Get your test Lemon Squeezy API Keys

Once you've created your account, you'll need to get your test API keys. You can do that by navigating to [https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/api](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/api) and creating a new API key:
1. Click on the `+` button.
2. Give your API key a name.
3. Copy and paste it in your `.env.server` file under `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY`.

### Get your Lemon Squeezy Store ID

To get your store ID, go to the [Lemon Squeezy Dashboard](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/stores) and copy the `Store ID` from the top right corner.

<Image src={storeId} alt="store id" loading="lazy" />

Copy and paste this number in your `.env.server` file under `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID`.

### Create Test Products

To create a test product, go to the test products url [https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/products](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/products):

1. Click on the `+ New Product` button and fill in the relevant information for your product. 
2. Fill in the general information.
3. For pricing, select the type of product you'd like to create, e.g. `Subscription` for a recurring monthly payment product or  `Single Payment` for credits-based product.
   <Image src={addProduct} alt="add product" loading="lazy" />
4. Make sure you select `Software as a service (SaaS)` as the Tax category type.
5. If you want to add different price tiers for `Subscription` products, click on `add variant` under the `variants` tab. Here you can input the name of the variant (e.g. "Hobby", "Pro"), and that variant's price.
   <Image src={addVariant} alt="add variant" loading="lazy" />
6. For a product with no variants, on the product page, click the `...` menu button and select `Copy variant ID`
   <Image src={variantId} alt="variant id" loading="lazy" />
7. For a product with variants, on the product page, click on the product, go to the variants tab and select `Copy ID` for each variant.
   <Image src={subscriptionVariantIds} alt="subscription variant ids" loading="lazy" />
8. Paste these IDs in the `.env.server` file:
   - We've set you up with two example subscription product environment variables, `PAYMENTS_HOBBY_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN_ID` and `PAYMENTS_PRO_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN_ID`.
   - As well as a one-time payment product/credits-based environment variable, `PAYMENTS_CREDITS_10_PLAN_ID`.

Note that if you change the names of the these environment variables, you'll need to update your app code to match these names as well.

### Create and Use the Lemon Squeezy Webhook in Local Development

Lemon Squeezy sends messages/updates to your Wasp app via its webhook, e.g. when a payment is successful. For that to work during development, we need to expose our locally running (via `wasp start`) Wasp app and make it available online, specifically the server part of it. Since the Wasp server runs on port 3001, you should run ngrok on port 3001, which will provide you with a public URL that you can use to configure Lemon Squeezy with.

To do this, first make sure you have installed [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/).

Once installed, and with your wasp app running, run:
```sh
ngrok http 3001
```

<Image src={ngrok} alt="ngrok" loading="lazy" />

Ngrok will output a forwarding address for you. Copy and paste this address and add `/payments-webhook` to the end (this URL path has been configured for you already in `main.wasp` under the `api paymentsWebhook` definition). It should look something like this: 

```sh title="Callback URL"
https://89e5-2003-c7-153c-72a5-f837.ngrok-free.app/payments-webhook
```

Now go to your [Lemon Squeezy Webhooks Dashboard](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/webhooks):
1. Click the `+` button.
2. Add the newly created webhook forwarding url to the `Callback URL` section.
3. Give your webhook a signing secret (a long, random string).
4. Copy and paste this same signing secret into your `.env.server` file under `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
5. Make sure to select at least the following updates to be sent:
   - `order_created`
   - `subscription_created`
   - `subscription_updated`
   - `subscription_cancelled`
6. Click `save`.

You're now ready to start consuming Lemon Squeezy webhook events in local development.
