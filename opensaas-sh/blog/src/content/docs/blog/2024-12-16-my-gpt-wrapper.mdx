Hey builders,

I wanted to share my journey building a micro-SaaS, [CoverLetterGPT](https://coverlettergpt.xyz/), which now earns **$550/month in recurring revenue (MRR)**—all while requiring **minimal effort and maintenance**. Here's how I did it and why I believe small, simple SaaS apps are an underrated way to start as an indie maker.

### Quick Stats:

- **Built in 1 week** 
  - using [Wasp](https://wasp.sh/), a React, NodeJS, & Prisma framework
  - and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for the design system.
- **Runs on autopilot**
- **~$550 MRR** after one year
- Minimal customer support—only **3 Stripe disputes** to date
- Costs **~$15/month** to operate (hosting + OpenAI API fees)
- Deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/) & [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)

BTW, I built [Open SaaS](https://opensaas.sh), the free, open-source SaaS template based on what I learned from building and launching CoverLetterGPT. 

Because Open SaaS is a community-driven project, it also benefits from community feedback and contributions, so it boasts a clean codebase and a ton of useful features. Check it out and give us a star! We're always improving it.

### Small Wins Are Worth It

Many developers think a SaaS has to be big, flashy, or wildly profitable to be worth building. I disagree. For me:

- $550/month is fantastic as side income.
- It runs itself, requiring virtually no maintenance.
- I can balance it easily alongside my full-time job.
- It's fun and doesn't consume my free time.

Here's why I think you should aim for small, achievable SaaS projects instead of trying to “hit it big” from the start.

### Build & Launch Fast

The most important lesson I've learned: **speed is everything.** The faster you launch, the faster you'll know if your idea works. Here's what worked for me:

1. **Avoid long, drawn-out failures:** Build small, execute early.
2. **Use the fastest tools available:** I used [Wasp](https://wasp.sh/) because it gives me all the building blocks already set up (auth, database, cron jobs, email sending), letting me focus on the business logic of the app. Paired with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), I was able to build the app in about 1 week.
3. **Forget perfection:** I didn't worry about making it pretty or perfect—it just had to work.

### Keep It Simple

The beauty of micro-SaaS is in its simplicity. Here's why:

- My app does **one thing well**: generating cover letters based on résumés and job descriptions.
- There's no need for a fancy landing page or marketing gimmicks. This is my 🌶 hot take.
- Users get **3 trial credits**—enough to try the app and see value before paying.

One of the biggest perks of micro-SaaS is how low-maintenance it can be. With CoverLetterGPT, I rarely handle customer service thanks to its simplicity.

This means I spend my time on **new ideas** rather than maintaining old ones.

### It's All About Tradeoffs

While I could optimize and grow CoverLetterGPT further, I've chosen to keep it small and simple. For me:

- **Small wins** are still wins.
- I value having a side project that's easy to manage alongside my full-time job.
- I'd rather have **less stress** than chase higher profits.

### Final Thoughts

If you're considering building a SaaS, **don't overthink it.** Start small, move fast, and treat it as an experiment. Forget the “rules” and focus on launching. Here's what matters most:

- Keep it simple: Build an app that solves one problem well.
- Launch fast: Test your idea and iterate based on real feedback.
- Minimize effort: Aim for maximum reward with minimal maintenance.

For me, **$550 MRR** isn't just “enough”—it's amazing. It's proof that small, focused apps can succeed, and they're a great way to build confidence and skills as a maker.
