+# Wasp App
+
+This project uses Wasp, a batteries-included framework for building full-stack web apps with React, Node.js, and Prisma.
+
+## Development Guidelines
+
+### Start a Wasp Development Session with Full Debugging Visibility
+
+Run the plugin's `start-dev-server` skill with the recommended options to give Claude full debugging visibility:
+  - Start the Wasp development server as a background task to give Claude direct access to server logs and build errors.
+  - Select the Chrome DevTools MCP server to give Claude visibility into browser console logs, UI functionality, network requests, and runtime errors.
+
+### Documentation
+
+Always fetch and verify your knowledge against the current Wasp documentation before taking on tasks, answering questions, or doing any development work in a Wasp project as your Wasp knowledge may be outdated:
+1. Run `wasp version` to get the current Wasp CLI version.
+2. Find and fetch the correct version of the Wasp documentation maps from the [LLMs.txt index](https://wasp.sh/llms.txt). The map contains raw markdown file GitHub URLs of all documentation sections.
+3. Fetch the guides relevant to the current task or query from those raw.githubusercontent.com URLs directly - do NOT use HTML page URLs.
+
+### Schema Changes
+
+Changes to `schema.prisma` are not applied until `wasp db migrate-dev --name <descriptive-name>` runs. Continue coding freely and tell the user to run migrations when ready to test.
+
+**Track pending migrations:** The dev server warns about this, but users may miss it if Wasp is running as a background task. Remind them of this before testing/viewing the app, and offer to run migrations for them.
+
+## Project Reference
+
+### Structure
+
+```
+.
+├── .wasp/                    # Wasp output (auto-generated, do not edit)
+├── public/                   # Static assets
+├── src/                      # Feature code: server `operations.ts` and client `pages.tsx` files
+├── main.wasp or main.wasp.ts # Wasp config file: routes, pages, auth, operations, jobs, etc.
+├── schema.prisma             # Database schema (Prisma)
+```
+
+### Recommended Code Organization
+
+Unless user specifies otherwise, use a vertical, per-feature code organization (not per-type):
+
+```
+src/
+├── tasks/
+│   ├── TasksPage.tsx      # Page component
+│   ├── TaskList.tsx       # Component
+│   └── operations.ts      # Queries & actions
+├── auth/
+│   ├── LoginPage.tsx
+│   └── google.ts
+```
+
+### Starter Templates
+
+Highly recommend that the user chose one of the following templates when scaffolding a new Wasp app:
+```bash
+wasp new my-basic-app -t basic # creates a basic starter app with core Wasp features like auth, operations, pages, etc.
+wasp new my-saas-app -t saas # creates a full-featured SaaS starter app with auth, payments, demo app, AWS S3, and more (OpenSaaS.sh)
+```
+
+See the **Starter Templates** section in the Wasp documentation for more templates.
+
+### Customization
+
+**Do NOT configure Vite, Express, React Query, etc. the usual way.** Wasp has its own mechanisms for customizing these tools. See the **Project Setup & Customization** section in the Wasp docs.
+
+### Advanced Features
+
+Wasp provides **advanced features**:
+- custom HTTP API endpoints
+- background (cron) jobs
+- type-safe links
+- websockets
+- middleware
+- email sending
+
+See the **Advanced Features** section in the Wasp docs for more details.
+
+### Wasp Conventions
+
+#### Imports
+**In TypeScript files:**
+- ✅ `import type { User } from 'wasp/entities'`
+- ✅ `import type { GetTasks } from 'wasp/server/operations'`
+- ✅ `import { getTasks, createTask, useQuery } from 'wasp/client/operations'`
+- ✅ `import { SubscriptionStatus } from '@prisma/client'` (for Prisma enums)
+- ✅ Local code: relative paths `import { X } from './X'`
+
+**In main.wasp:**
+- ✅ `fn: import { getTasks } from "@src/tasks/operations"`
+- ❌ Never relative paths
+
+**In main.wasp.ts:**
+See the **TypeScript Config** section in the Wasp docs for more details.
+
+#### Operations
+- ⚠️ Call actions directly using `async/await`. DO NOT use Wasp's `useAction` hook unless optimistic updates are needed.
+
+## Troubleshooting
+
+### Debugging
+
+Always ground your knowledge against the [Wasp documentation](#documentation).
+
+If you don't have full debugging visibility as described in the [Start a Wasp Development Session with Full Debugging Visibility](#start-a-wasp-development-session-with-full-debugging-visibility) section, do the following:
+  1. Insist that the user run the `start-dev-server` skill as described in the [Start a Wasp Development Session with Full Debugging Visibility](#start-a-wasp-development-session-with-full-debugging-visibility) section.
+  2. If the user refuses, ask them to share the output of the `wasp start` command and the browser console logs.
+
+### Common Mistakes
+
+| Symptom | Fix |
+|---------|-----|
+| `context.entities.X undefined` | Add entity to `entities: [...]` in main.wasp |
+| Schema changes not applying | Run `wasp db migrate-dev --name <descriptive-name>` |
+| Can't login after email signup with `Dummy` email provider | Check the server logs for the verification link or set SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_IN_DEV=true in .env.server |
+| Types stale/IDE errors after changes | Restart TS server `Cmd+Shift+P`|
+| Wasp not recognizing changes | **WAIT PATIENTLY** as Wasp recompiles the project. Re-run `wasp start` if necessary.|
+| Persistent weirdness after waiting patiently and restarting. | Run `wasp clean` && `wasp start` |
