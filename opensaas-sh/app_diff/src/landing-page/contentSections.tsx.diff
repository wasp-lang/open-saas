The documentation is superb and I see the GitHub is super active. The team is super responsive and the ai kapa rocks! So thanks for the work you all are doing. I’ve done plenty of with  react in the past but I’m a front end person.  With wasp though, I'm managing my db, back end functions, actions, queries, all with so much ease. I occasionally get stuck on an issue but within a day or two, and thanks to a couple of AI assistants, I get through it. So thank you!",
